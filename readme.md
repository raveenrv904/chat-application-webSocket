# WebSocket Chat Application


## Features

- **Real-time messaging**: Messages appear instantly for all connected users
- **User presence**: See who's currently online in the chat room
- **Typing indicators**: Know when other users are typing
- **Connection status**: Visual indicator showing connection status
- **Responsive design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- React (with Vite)
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Socket.io client for WebSocket communication

### Backend
- Node.js
- Express
- Socket.io for WebSocket server implementation
- CORS for cross-origin resource sharing

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14+ recommended)
- npm or yarn

## Installation

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/raveenrv904/chat-appliction-webSocket.git
cd websocket-chat
```

### Backend Setup

```bash
# Navigate to backend directory
cd chat-backend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm start
```

The backend server will run on http://localhost:3001

### Frontend Setup

```bash
# Navigate to frontend directory
cd chat-frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

The frontend development server will run on http://localhost:5173

## How to Use

1. Start both the backend and frontend servers as described in the Installation section
2. Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser
3. Enter your name to join the chat
4. Open another browser window/tab or device to see real-time communication in action
5. Start chatting!

## WebSocket Implementation Details

### Server-Side (Node.js + Socket.io)

The server manages the WebSocket connections and handles different events:

- **Connection**: When a user connects to the WebSocket server
- **User Joined**: When a user enters their name and joins the chat
- **Send Message**: When a user sends a message
- **Typing**: When a user is typing a message
- **Disconnect**: When a user closes the browser or leaves the chat

### Client-Side (React + Socket.io-client)

The React frontend uses a custom hook (`useSocket.js`) to manage the WebSocket connection and events:

- **Connect**: Establish a connection to the WebSocket server
- **Emit Events**: Send events to the server (e.g., joining, sending messages)
- **Listen to Events**: Receive events from the server (e.g., new messages, users joining)
- **Disconnect**: Clean up and close the connection

## Socket Events

| Event | Direction | Purpose |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| `connect` | Client ← Server | Connection established |
| `disconnect` | Client ← Server | Connection closed |
| `user-joined` | Client ↔ Server | New user enters the chat |
| `user-left` | Client ← Server | User leaves the chat |
| `send-message` | Client → Server | Send a new message |
| `receive-message` | Client ← Server | Receive a new message |
| `typing` | Client → Server | Indicate user is typing |
| `user-typing` | Client ← Server | Show who is typing |
| `active-users` | Client ← Server | List of currently active users |

## Understanding WebSockets

Unlike traditional HTTP requests, WebSockets provide a persistent connection between the client and server, allowing:

- **Bi-directional communication**: Both client and server can initiate communication
- **Real-time updates**: No need to refresh or poll for new data
- **Reduced overhead**: Less network traffic compared to repeated HTTP requests
- **Lower latency**: Immediate data transfer without connection setup for each message

## Extending the Application

Here are some ideas to enhance this chat application:

1. **User authentication**: Add login/signup functionality
2. **Private messaging**: Allow users to send direct messages
3. **Chat rooms**: Create multiple chat rooms for different topics
4. **Message history**: Store messages in a database to load chat history
5. **File sharing**: Add capability to share images or files
6. **Emoji support**: Add emoji picker for more expressive chats
7. **Message read receipts**: Show when messages are read
8. **User profiles**: Add avatars and profiles
9. **Mobile app**: Convert to a mobile app using React Native
10. **End-to-end encryption**: Add security for private conversations

## Common Issues

### CORS Errors
If you see CORS-related errors in the console, ensure the CORS settings in the backend are properly configured:

```javascript
const io = socketIo(server, {
  cors: {
    origin: "http://localhost:5173", // React dev server URL
    methods: ["GET", "POST"]
  }
});
```

### Connection Issues
If the client cannot connect to the WebSocket server:
- Check that both servers are running
- Verify the WebSocket server URL in the client code
- Ensure no firewalls are blocking WebSocket connections

### Duplicate Users
If you see duplicate users in the active users list:
- Check the user-joined event handler for proper deduplication logic
- Ensure user IDs are consistent across events
